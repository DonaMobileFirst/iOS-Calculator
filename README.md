### Clone Coding of iOS Calculator App

* 100% Implemented except for scientific (landscape) mode. 
	* There are so many sub-features in addition to standard ones for calculator. Input order, for example, determines the way of calculating.  
	* Awesome button effect, Fluid Interface, has been implemented. 
* Tried to make it with clean structure (at least).
* Tried to separate business logic from UI codes. 
* Cared about reusability and readability.
